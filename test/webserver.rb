    WEBrick is a Ruby library that makes it easy to build an HTTP server with Ruby. 
    It comes with most installations of Ruby by default (itâ€™s part of the standard library), 
    so you can usually create a basic web/HTTP server with only several lines of code.
    
    The following code creates a generic WEBrick server on the local machine on port 1234, 
    shuts the server down if the process is interrupted (often done with Ctrl+C).
    This example lets you call the URL's: "add" and "subtract" and pass through arguments to them
    Example usage: 
        http://localhost:1234/ (this will show the specified error message)
        http://localhost:1234/add?a=10&b=10 
        http://localhost:1234/subtract?a=10&b=9
